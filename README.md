Welcome to my 5d Walking Project
================================

I created this as an experiential art project for the 5d Fundamentals art course.

It's intention is to make the participants more aware of the space around them, and the size and pattern of their walk from point A to point B.

It's inspiration comes from my time in the marching band in high school. We were given a certain number of counts to get from one mark to the next and had to make our steps as even as possible.


About the Project
----------------

### Supplies

- A moblie device.
- Internet connection.
- Hiro and kanji markers.
- Space.

### Instructions

Print out some hiro and kanji markers. Place them around your space at varying distances.
Make sure your volume is up, headphones are optional, and may make your experience more personal.
Go to [5d-walking-project.glitch.me](https://5d-walking-project.glitch.me)

You will hear a metronome. You must walk in time to the beat.
Aim your camera at one of the markers, a number will appear. That is how many counts you are allowed to take to the next marker.
Walk the path you have made. Change up the order you go to the markers. Experience how your walk changes. This part is entirely personal.

### OPTIONAL ALTERATIONS/SUGGESTIONS:

You may choose to not have your volume up and play music from another source. Walk to the beat of this song. How does this change your experience?
Do this in a small space, then a large. Inside, then outside. Private, then public. Does the contrast between these spaces make you feel a certain way?
